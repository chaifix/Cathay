Cathay is a toy web server supports a subset of HTTP 1.1. 
Notice that this project is still in development and very 
silly at the present. The prototype was made in Computer 
Network course in early 2016. 

To build it, you just simply compile several source files 
inside the src directory. It should works on both windows 
and linux. If you get some trouble, send email to me and 
I will fix it. 

To launch the server, run the following command: 
    
    cathay <portnumber>

Then type "http://localhost:<portnumber>/index.html" in 
your browser address bar and hit enter, you should be able 
to get some feedback. Screenshot:

Again, this project is still at an early stage. Maybe some 
day, it will be released as the final version.
